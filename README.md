# Module 4 Challenge:  Coding Quiz

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have created a coding quiz with information about JavaScript.  When you click "Start" on the quiz, the countdown will start in the top left corner and the questions will display.  When you choose the correct answer, "Correct!" will display on the next screen.  If you choose a wrong answer, "Wrong!" will display on the next screen.  After you complete the quiz OR when the countdown runs out of time, you will be asked to input your initials.  Your score and initials will then be saved for future players to compete against you.

There are some parts of this quiz that I would still like to improve after I have gained more working knowledge about JavaScript.  The biggest issue currently is with the High Scores display.  I would like to click on the High Scores link in the top right corner and be taken to see the current high scores before starting the quiz.  I could then return to the main screen by clicking the "Coding Quiz" main title in the center of the page.  I would appreciate any feedback on accomplishing this for  a future resubmit if that is needed.

I could not have completed this project without the help of many people in my program, including multiple tutors, TA's, and classmates.  I have so much gratitude for them helping me with my code and helping me with concepts with which I was struggling.
